# qrorcid

qrorcid is a web app that enables you to create a QR code based on your [ORCID](http://orcid.org) record, to use on printed materials. It also allows you to buy stickers with your QR code from Zazzle!

This project was started at [ORCID CodeFest 2014 Chicago](http://www.hackathon.io/orcid6) by [Will Simpson](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4654-1403).

It was tweaked after the CodeFest to bring it up to production quality, and is now hosted at [http://qrcode.orcid.org](http://qrcode.orcid.org).
